Just need:
- Which tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI)
- What's broken (not following instructions/rate limits/slow/hallucinating)  
- Since when

That's it. Together we'll figure out if AI is having a bad day for everyone or just you.

## Why this exists

Coding with LLMs is becoming essential. But when they start lagging, throwing errors, or giving nonsense outputs - you wonder: *"Is it just me?"*

This repo tracks degradations in real-time through crowd-sourced reports. Just actual developers reporting actual problems.

## AI Tools Tracked

- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's CLI for Claude
- **Gemini CLI** - Google's command-line interface for Gemini
- **Codex CLI** - OpenAI's code generation CLI
